# 🎉 BOOKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 📋 Project Summary

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 🛡️ 1. Booking Visibility in Navbar

**✅ CUSTOMER NAVBAR:**
- Added "My Bookings" link for customers
- Shows booked property details, booking date, and current status
- Displays status messages:

  - 🎉 **Confirmed**: "🎉 Congratulations! Your booking has been confirmed."
  - ❌ **Rejected**: "❌ Unfortunately, your booking has been declined."

**✅ AGENT NAVBAR:**
- Added "My Bookings" link for agents to manage their property bookings

**✅ ADMIN NAVBAR:**
- Added "Admin Bookings" link for full oversight

### 🗂️ 2. Admin Dashboard - Full Control

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 📁 New Files Created:
1. **`AgentBookingsView`** - Agent-specific booking management
2. **`update_booking_status`** - Unified status update function
3. **Enhanced templates:**
   - `agent_bookings.html` - Agent booking dashboard
   - `admin_bookings.html` - Admin oversight panel
   - Enhanced `my_bookings.html` - Customer booking view

### 🔗 URL Patterns Added:
```python
# Agent booking management
path('agent/bookings/', AgentBookingsView, name='agent_bookings')
path('booking/update-status/<int:booking_id>/', update_booking_status, name='update_booking_status')
```

### 🛡️ Permission System:
- **Customers**: Can only view their own bookings
