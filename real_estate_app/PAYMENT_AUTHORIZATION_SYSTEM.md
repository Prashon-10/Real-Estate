# 💳 Payment Authorization System Implementation

## 🎯 **Real-World Payment Flow Implemented**

I've implemented a **professional payment authorization/capture system** that mirrors real-world payment processing:

### 🔄 **Payment Flow Stages:**

```
1. User Books Property → Payment AUTHORIZED (Money Held) 💰🔒
2. Agent Reviews Booking → Decision Time ⏳
3. Agent Confirms → Payment CAPTURED (Money Charged) ✅💳
4. Agent Rejects → Authorization CANCELLED (Money Released) ❌🔓
```

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation:**

### **1. Enhanced PropertyBooking Model** (`properties/models.py`)

#### **New Payment Status Options:**
```python
PAYMENT_STATUS_CHOICES = [
    ('pending', 'Payment Pending'),
    ('authorized', 'Payment Authorized (Hold)'),     # 🔒 Money held, not charged
    ('captured', 'Payment Captured (Charged)'),     # ✅ Money actually charged
    ('failed', 'Payment Failed'),
    ('refunded', 'Payment Refunded'),
    ('cancelled', 'Payment Cancelled'),              # ❌ Authorization released
]
```

#### **New Fields Added:**
```python
payment_intent_id = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)  # Stripe Payment Intent ID
payment_status = models.CharField(choices=PAYMENT_STATUS_CHOICES, default='pending')
payment_authorized_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
payment_captured_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
payment_refunded_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
```

#### **Smart Payment Methods:**
```python
def authorize_payment(self):
    """Hold money without charging (real-world: Stripe pre-authorization)"""
    
def capture_payment(self):
    """Actually charge the held money"""
    
def cancel_authorization(self):
    """Release held money back to customer"""
    
def refund_payment(self):
    """Refund already charged money"""
```

---

### **2. Updated Booking Flow** (`properties/booking_views.py`)

#### **Initial Booking (Money Held, Not Charged):**
```python
def create_demo_booking(user, booking_data, payment_method, transaction_id):
    booking = PropertyBooking(
        # ... booking details ...
        payment_status='authorized',  # ← Money held, not charged
        payment_authorized_at=timezone.now(),
        payment_data={
            'note': 'Demo payment - Money is held until booking confirmation'
        }
    )
```

#### **Agent Decision Processing:**
```python
def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    # When agent confirms booking
    if booking.status == 'confirmed':
        success = booking.capture_payment()  # 💳 Charge the money
        message = f"Payment of Rs. {booking.payment_amount} charged successfully."
    
    # When agent rejects booking
    elif booking.status == 'rejected':
        success = booking.cancel_authorization()  # 🔓 Release the money
        message = f"Held payment of Rs. {booking.payment_amount} released to customer."
```

## 🎊 **Real-World Scenario Example:**

### **Scenario: User books "Beautiful House in Budhanilkantha"**

1. **Day 1 - Booking Placed:**
   ```
   User Status: "Payment authorized - Rs. 500 held (not charged yet)"
   Agent Status: "New booking with secured payment (Rs. 500 authorized)"
   System: payment_status = 'authorized'
   ```

2. **Day 2 - Agent Reviews:**
   ```
   Agent sees: Genuine booking (money secured), customer details, visit date
   Agent decides: Accept or Reject
   ```

3. **Day 3 - If Agent ACCEPTS:**
   ```
   User Status: "Booking confirmed! Payment completed - Rs. 500 charged"
   Agent Status: "Booking confirmed, payment captured successfully"
   System: payment_status = 'captured', money actually charged
   ```

3. **Day 3 - If Agent REJECTS:**
   ```
   User Status: "Booking rejected. Payment cancelled - Rs. 500 released to your account"
   Agent Status: "Booking rejected, held payment released to customer"
   System: payment_status = 'cancelled', money released back
   ```
