# Real Estate Application - Algorithm Summary

## Algorithm Overview

This document provides a concise overview of the key algorithms implemented in the Django real estate application.

---

## 1. Semantic Search Algorithm

**Purpose**: Intelligent property search using AI-powered semantic understanding instead of keyword matching.

**How it works**: 
- Converts user queries and property descriptions into 384-dimensional vectors using SentenceTransformers
- Compares vectors using cosine similarity to find semantically similar properties
- Returns properties with similarity scores above 0.2 threshold

**Formula**: 
```
similarity(query, property) = (q⃗ · p⃗) / (||q⃗|| × ||p⃗||)
```

**Example**: Search for "cozy family home" finds properties described as "warm family residence"

---

## 2. Property Filtering Algorithm

**Purpose**: Multi-criteria property filtering for precise search results.

**Filters Applied**:
- Price range: [min_price, max_price]
- Bedrooms: minimum count
- Bathrooms: minimum count  
- Square footage: [min_sqft, max_sqft]
- Status: available/pending/sold

**Performance**: O(n × f) where n = properties, f = number of filters

---

## 3. Recommendation Scoring Algorithm

**Purpose**: Rank properties based on search relevance with decay scoring.

**Formula**:
```
Score(rank) = 1.0 - (rank × 0.05)
```

**Examples**:
- 1st place: Score = 1.0
- 2nd place: Score = 0.95
- 10th place: Score = 0.50

**Future Enhancement**: Time-based decay for fresh recommendations

---

## 4. User Authentication Algorithm

**Purpose**: Role-based access control with three user types.

**User Roles & Permissions**:
- **Customer**: View properties, save favorites, send messages
- **Agent**: All customer permissions + create/update/delete properties
- **Admin**: Full system access

**Security**: Multi-layer validation with session management

---

## 5. Property Ranking Algorithm

**Purpose**: Sort and paginate property listings efficiently.

**Sort Options**:
- Newest first (default)
- Price ascending/descending
- Bedroom count descending

**Pagination**: 9 properties per page with optimized database queries

---

## 6. Message Priority Algorithm

**Purpose**: Intelligent message prioritization for agent notifications.

**Priority Calculation**:
```
Priority = 0.4 × Recency + 0.3 × UserType + 0.3 × PropertyValue
```

**Components**:
- **Recency**: Exponential decay (newer = higher priority)
- **UserType**: Premium users get higher priority
- **PropertyValue**: High-value properties get priority

**Notification Rules**:
- Priority > 0.8: Immediate push notification
- Priority > 0.6: Email notification
- Priority ≤ 0.6: Dashboard notification only

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimization
- **select_related()**: Reduces N+1 query problems
- **prefetch_related()**: Efficient loading of related objects
- **Indexing**: O(log n) query performance

### Caching Strategy
- **Redis caching**: 1-hour cache for search results
- **Cache keys**: MD5 hash of search queries
- **Cache warming**: Proactive loading of popular searches

## Algorithm Complexities

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Semantic Search | O(n × d) | O(n × d) |
| Property Filtering | O(n × f) | O(k) |
| Recommendations | O(n) | O(k) |
| Authentication | O(1) | O(u) |
| Message Priority | O(1) | O(1) |

**Legend**: n=properties, d=embedding dimension, f=filters, k=results, u=users

## Key Configuration

```python
# Core Settings
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.2
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION = 384
PROPERTIES_PER_PAGE = 9
RECOMMENDATION_DECAY = 0.05
CACHE_EXPIRY = 3600  # 1 hour

# Priority Weights
RECENCY_WEIGHT = 0.4
USER_TYPE_WEIGHT = 0.3
PROPERTY_VALUE_WEIGHT = 0.3
```

## Implementation Highlights

1. **AI-Powered Search**: Uses 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model for semantic understanding
2. **Efficient Filtering**: Django QuerySet optimization with lazy evaluation
3. **Smart Recommendations**: Ranking-based scoring with future personalization support
4. **Secure Access**: RBAC system with role-based permissions
5. **Intelligent Messaging**: Priority-based notification routing
6. **Performance Focus**: Caching, query optimization, and pagination

This algorithm suite provides intelligent, scalable, and user-friendly property search and management capabilities for the real estate application.
