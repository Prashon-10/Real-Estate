# Corrected Same-Day Booking Logic

## Business Rules (Fixed Implementation)

### Rule 1: One Agent Per Day
- **Core Rule**: A user can only book properties from **ONE agent per day**
- **Restriction**: Users cannot book with different agents on the same date
- **Rationale**: Prevents scheduling conflicts and ensures agents can properly coordinate visits

### Rule 2: Multiple Properties from Same Agent Allowed
- **Permission**: If a user already has a booking with an agent on a specific day, they CAN book additional properties from that SAME agent
- **Distance Restriction**: Additional properties from the same agent must be within 5km of each other
- **Rationale**: Same agent can coordinate multiple nearby visits in one day

### Rule 3: Distance Validation for Same Agent
- **5km Rule**: Properties booked with the same agent on the same day must be within 5km of each other
- **Purpose**: Ensures logistical feasibility for the agent to handle multiple visits
- **Fallback**: If coordinates are missing, booking is allowed (agent assumes responsibility)

## Implementation Details

### Backend Logic (utils.py)
```python
# Primary check: Different agents = conflict
if existing_property.agent != new_property.agent:
    conflicting_bookings.append(booking)  # Block different agents
    
# Secondary check: Same agent + distance validation
if distance > 5.0:  # More than 5km apart with same agent
    conflicting_bookings.append(booking)  # Block distant properties
```

### Frontend Validation (booking_form.html)
```javascript
if (userConflict.agent === currentAgent) {
    // Same agent - allow but warn about distance
    alert("You can book additional properties from the same agent...")
} else {
    // Different agent - block completely
    alert("You can only book from ONE agent per day...")
    return; // Prevent booking
}
```

### Error Messages
1. **Different Agent Conflict**: 
   - "You can only book properties from ONE agent per day"
   - Lists existing booking with different agent
   - Suggests selecting different date

2. **Same Agent Distance Conflict**:
   - "You cannot book properties from the same agent that are more than 5km apart"
   - Shows distance between properties
   - Suggests closer properties or different date

## Examples

### ✅ ALLOWED Scenarios
1. **Single Booking**: User books one property from Agent A on Monday
2. **Multiple Same Agent (Close)**: User books Property 1 from Agent A, then Property 2 from Agent A (3km away) on same day
3. **Different Days**: User books Agent A on Monday, Agent B on Tuesday

### ❌ BLOCKED Scenarios
1. **Different Agents Same Day**: User books Agent A on Monday, tries to book Agent B on Monday
2. **Same Agent Too Far**: User books Property 1 from Agent A, tries to book Property 2 from Agent A (8km away) on same day
3. **Duplicate Property**: User tries to book the same property twice

## Previous Logic Issues (Fixed)
- **Wrong**: Previously allowed different agents on same day without restrictions
- **Wrong**: Applied distance restrictions to different agents
- **Correct**: Now blocks different agents completely, applies distance only to same agent

## Database Changes
No database changes required - logic is purely in validation layer.

## Files Modified
1. `properties/utils.py` - Backend validation logic
2. `templates/properties/booking_form.html` - Frontend validation messages
3. This documentation file

## Testing Scenarios
1. Book with Agent A → Try Agent B same day (should fail)
2. Book with Agent A → Book another property from Agent A nearby (should succeed)
3. Book with Agent A → Book another property from Agent A far away (should fail with distance message)
4. Book property → Try same property again (should fail with duplicate message)
