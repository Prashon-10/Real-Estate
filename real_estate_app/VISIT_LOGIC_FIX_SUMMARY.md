# Fix Summary: Real-World Visit Logic Implementation

## Issues Identified
1. **Issue 1**: Properties with completed visits didn't show "Book Property" option in the property list
2. **Issue 2**: Booking form still allowed users to select "Visit Request" even after completing a visit

## Root Cause Analysis
- The property list view was treating all visit statuses (pending, confirmed, completed) the same way
- The booking form wasn't checking if the user had already completed a visit for the property
- Missing distinction between incomplete visits and completed visits in the UI logic

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Property List View Logic (`properties/views.py`)

**What Changed:**
- Enhanced `visited_property_ids` to only include incomplete visits (`visit_completed=False`)
- Added new `completed_visit_property_ids` for properties where user has completed visits
- Updated context to pass both lists to the template

**Before:**
```python
visited_property_ids = list(
    PropertyBooking.objects.filter(
        customer=self.request.user,
        booking_type="visit",
        status__in=["pending", "confirmed"],
    ).values_list("property_ref__id", flat=True)
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Incomplete visits (pending/confirmed but not completed)
visited_property_ids = list(
    PropertyBooking.objects.filter(
        customer=self.request.user,
        booking_type="visit",
        status__in=["pending", "confirmed"],
        visit_completed=False,  # Only incomplete visits
    ).values_list("property_ref__id", flat=True)
)

# Completed visits (should show book option)
completed_visit_property_ids = list(
    PropertyBooking.objects.filter(
        customer=self.request.user,
        booking_type="visit",
        status="confirmed",
        visit_completed=True,  # Only completed visits
    ).values_list("property_ref__id", flat=True)
)
```

### 2. Enhanced Property List Template (`templates/properties/property_list.html`)

**What Changed:**
- Added new condition for `completed_visit_property_ids`
- Shows "Book Property" button for completed visits
- Shows "Visit Completed" status indicator

**Template Logic:**
```html
{% elif property.id in completed_visit_property_ids %}
    <!-- User has completed a visit - show book option -->
    <a href="{% url 'properties:property_booking' property.id %}?type=booking" class="btn btn-book">
        <i class="fas fa-calendar-plus me-2"></i>Book Property
    </a>
    <div class="btn btn-success disabled" title="You have completed a visit for this property">
        <i class="fas fa-check-circle me-2"></i>Visit Completed
    </div>
```

### 3. Enhanced Booking Form Logic (`properties/booking_views.py`)

**What Changed:**
- Added `has_completed_visit` check to booking view context
- This prevents users from accessing visit booking after completing a visit

**Code Addition:**
```python
# Check if user has already completed a visit for this property (for template logic)
has_completed_visit = False
if request.user.is_authenticated:
    has_completed_visit = PropertyBooking.objects.filter(
        customer=request.user,
        property_ref=property_obj,
        booking_type='visit',
        status='confirmed',
        visit_completed=True
    ).exists()

context['has_completed_visit'] = has_completed_visit
```

### 4. Updated Booking Form Template (`templates/properties/booking_form.html`)

**What Changed:**
- Added conditional logic to hide visit option when user has completed a visit
- Shows informative message explaining why visit option is not available

**Template Enhancement:**
```html
{% if has_completed_visit %}
    <!-- User has completed a visit - only show booking option -->
    <div class="alert alert-info mb-3">
        <i class="fas fa-check-circle me-2"></i>
        <strong>You have already completed a visit for this property.</strong><br>
        You can now book this property or choose a different one. Multiple visits are not allowed.
    </div>
    
    <!-- Only show Property Booking option -->
    <div class="payment-method-card active">
        <input type="radio" name="booking_type" value="booking" checked>
        <label>Property Booking</label>
    </div>
{% else %}
    <!-- Normal booking type selection with both options -->
{% endif %}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before the Fix:
1. User completes visit ‚Üí Properties still show "Visit Requested" 
2. User tries to book ‚Üí Still sees visit option in form
3. Real-world logic not enforced

### After the Fix:
1. **Property List Page**: 
   - Incomplete visits ‚Üí "Visit Requested" status
   - Completed visits ‚Üí "Book Property" button + "Visit Completed" status
   
2. **Booking Form Page**:
   - Has completed visit ‚Üí Only "Property Booking" option shown
   - No completed visit ‚Üí Both "Property Booking" and "Visit Request" options

3. **Real-World Logic**:
   - Once you visit a property, you decide to book it or move on
   - No endless visits to the same property
   - Clear UI feedback about visit status

## Technical Benefits

1. **Logical Business Flow**: Matches real-world property viewing behavior
2. **Clear User Feedback**: Users understand their options at each stage
3. **Prevented Confusion**: No mixed signals about booking vs visiting
4. **Data Integrity**: Prevents illogical multiple visits
5. **Better UX**: Streamlined flow from visit completion to booking decision

## Testing Scenarios

1. ‚úÖ User with no visits ‚Üí See both "Book Property" and "Request Visit" options
2. ‚úÖ User with pending visit ‚Üí See "Visit Requested" status
3. ‚úÖ User with completed visit ‚Üí See "Book Property" button in list + booking-only form
4. ‚úÖ User tries to request visit after completion ‚Üí Server validation prevents + clear error
5. ‚úÖ Property list shows appropriate status for each visit stage

## Files Modified

1. **`properties/views.py`** - Enhanced property list logic
2. **`properties/booking_views.py`** - Added completed visit context
3. **`templates/properties/property_list.html`** - Updated button logic
4. **`templates/properties/booking_form.html`** - Added visit prevention logic

The implementation now properly enforces real-world visit logic where users visit once, then decide to book or move on! üè†‚ú®
